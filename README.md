## Abstract
This project systematically reviews the role of **Digital Twin (DT)** technologies in the healthcare sector. Using a PRISMA-aligned selection methodology, we analyze 30 peer-reviewed studies across various clinical domains: surgery, oncology, cardiology, neurology, mental health, and chronic disease management. The review identifies key applications, benefits, challenges, and future research directions. A cost-benefit analysis is also carried out over a 5-year time horizon to quantify the actual economic results in the adoption of these technologies in fields such as Oncology and Surgery. 

**Keywords:** Digital Twins, Computational Modeling, Clinical Decision-Making, Healthcare Innovation, Precision Medicine, Medical Technology

## Research Question
> **How are Digital Twins used in different clinical specialties to support medical decision-making?**

---

## Methodology
- **Framework**: python implementation of the search engine , PRISMA 2020 compliance.
- **Corpus**: 130 scientific papers manually collected.
- **Filtering**: Semantic filtering via Python-based Boolean queries.
- **Final Selection**: 30 studies included.
- **Extraction Tools**: PyMuPDF, pandas for metadata organization. (using python) 

Semantic Query Focused On:
- Digital Twin concepts
- Medical/Healthcare domains
- Specific specialties (oncology, surgery, cardiology, etc.)
- Decision-making and predictive modeling

---

## Results
- **Surgery**: Enhanced preoperative planning and intraoperative precision.
- **Oncology**: Personalized treatment modeling and radiogenomics.
- **Cardiology**: Real-time monitoring, arrhythmia prediction.
- **Neurology/Mental Health**: Behavioral DTs for early disorder detection.
- **Chronic Disease**: Remote monitoring and self-managed care.
- **Computational Patient Models**: Disease progression simulation and therapy planning.

Tables and summary matrices have been provided for structured comparison across studies.

## Discussion
- **Strengths**:
  - Precision medicine support
  - Enhanced personalization
  - Real-time data integration
  - Privacy-preserving AI (e.g., federated learning)
- **Challenges**:
  - Lack of large-scale empirical validation
  - Interoperability with EHR systems
  - High computational costs
  - Ethical and privacy concerns
- **Future Directions**:
  - Standardization of DT models
  - Clinical trials and empirical outcome studies
  - Policy frameworks for cybersecurity and equity
  - Edge computing and 5G integration for real-time applications

## Conclusion
Digital Twin technologies hold transformative potential for personalized, predictive, and real-time healthcare. However, realizing their full benefits demands a shift toward validated clinical integration, regulatory adaptations, ethical governance, and scalable deployment models. Future advancements will redefine healthcare delivery, turning predictive intelligence into a foundational tool for patient care.
